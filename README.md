# Ready and fully implemented Instagram API client

There was also a frontend, but due to the peculiarities of the mac system it disappeared without a trace( (so the original repository was deleted, there were no commits, I threw it into this)

## From the functions: 

    Registration
    authorization
    creating posts
    writing comment
    likes
    reposts
    reels
    stories
    adding to favorites
    dialogues between users
    and so on  

## All that remains is a video of the site working
